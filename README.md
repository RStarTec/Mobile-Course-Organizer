## Mobile Course Organizer

----
### Purpose

This course app aims at providing students with handy access to course materials and educational tools on mobile devices. It has been developed and customized for the *CSC205 Computer Organization* course offered at Northern Virginia Community College.

We released this app as a template for educators who want to extend online education into the mobile domain, and for students who are looking for examples on app development.

----
### Prerequisites

This app requires access to:
* A public server where the course materials are to be hosted.
* An optional private server which hosts homework and grades available only to registered students.
